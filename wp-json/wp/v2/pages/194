When I take a walk to the Mendocino Headlands or along the seashore, I often stop and look at my surroundings and feel that I am in the center of Tao&#8217;s wonderful creation. I breathe in the world and engrave in my heart what creation offers me and am inspired by its beauty.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br>          I express myself by doing art. Many times I have difficulty in answering people when they ask me what kind of art work I do. I use any possible medium and style. I paint what I feel, what I think, what I see, and what I dream. A large portion of my art work comes from my dreams; a shaman in Korea once said that I have a shaman side in me and the capacity to enter dreamtime. I am a Buddhist and have spent time in a temple to become a Buddhist monk and strongly believe in reincarnation and karma and living life mindfully. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br>         I wish to communicate to the viewer the beauty and happiness I experienced while creating the art work. For me, doing art is to draw out images that have been swirling inside me for over forty years. Sometimes it comes out as an abstract or realistic work or an impressionist work. Sometimes it comes out as a conglomerate of these styles. Whatever my art work looks like, whatever my art work offers to others, I don&#8217;t explain it, since its the viewer&#8217;s job to appreciate my work in their own way. <\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artist Profile Inrae You Vinciguerra, a teacher, translator, artist, and journalist, was born in 1963 in South Korea.
