To the Fantastic Realist, artists and their creative process are extensions of the creative process of the universe, mediums through which magical powers fashion works of art.  To these artists art is beauty of spirit and art making is sacred practice, a vision quest for solidarity, spiritual unity, harmony, integration, and an enchantment that yields insight into the wonder of life&#8217;s sacred dimension. A Fantastic Realist believes that art making is a way of life and a calling and that art has the potential to elevate the human spirit and reveal the Great Spirit&#8217;s presence in all things. Yes, art makes visible invisible worlds and is a means to spiritual states of mind and harbors the capacity to purge and cleanse and to open one to the sublime. To me personally art making is a gateway to the Towerland, the mythic home of love, truth, beauty, inspiration, not a place but a space without boundaries, whose center lives everywhere.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong> <br>            In Fantastic Realism real success is achieved when one&#8217;s childlike qualities are retained into adulthood. \u201cWe must become children again, said the German artist Philipp Otto Runge, if we wish to achieve the best. To retain a child&#8217;s heart enables one to capture the soul of things and to remain open to creation&#8217;s Master Artist and the vital energy infusing all life and all enchanted art. Yes, real success is of the spirit<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br>           The Japanese painter Hokusai proved a kindred traveler on the Fantastic Realist path when he wrote, I have been in love with painting ever since I became conscious of it at the age of six. I drew some pictures I thought fairly good when I was fifty, but really nothing I did before the age of seventy was of any value at all. At seventy-three I have at last caught every aspect of nature &#8211; birds, fish, animals, insects, trees, grasses, all. When I am eighty I shall have developed still further, and I will really master the secrets of art at ninety. When I reach a hundred my work will be truly sublime, and my final goal will be attained around the age of one hundred and ten, when every line and dot I draw will be imbued with life.<br>         Yes, creation&#8217;s Master Artist and its work will be done in heaven as it is on earth and as it is in art. And what a wonderful thing it is, indeed.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artist Profile Louis was born in New York City and is an artist, teacher, playwright, and translator.
